 Create a BankInterface with methods getBalance and getInterestRate. Classes BankA, BankB, and BankC implement this, defining balances (₹10,000, ₹1,50,000, ₹2,00,000) and interest rates (7%, 7.4%, 7.9%). Instantiate each class, invoke methods, and display the balance and rate, demonstrating interfaces and polymorphism.
