 Create a BankInterface with methods getBalance and getInterestRate. Classes BankA, BankB, and BankC implement this, defining balances (₹10,000, ₹1,50,000, ₹2,00,000) and interest rates (7%, 7.4%, 7.9%). Instantiate each class, invoke methods, and display the balance and rate, demonstrating interfaces and polymorphism.

 
The second question involves creating a system to calculate the volume of water trapped between blocks of varying heights during the rainy season. Here's a concise description:

Develop a WaterConservationSystem interface with a method calculateTrappedWater(int[] blockHeights) to compute water volume trapped between city blocks. Implement an abstract class RainySeasonConservation that serves as a base for specific configurations. Create a concrete class CityBlockConservation extending it and providing logic to calculate water conservation using the array of block heights. For example, input {3, 0, 2, 0, 4} results in a trapped volume of 7 units.
